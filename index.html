            A barely fleshed out site used to practice the very basics of CSS styling, as well as implementing images and links to subpages. The images on the four subpages seem to be missing, and the best bet here is that we never added those image files to the repository. Now they are lost for <strong>all time</strong>.

            Though visually uninteresting, this project was created to practice CSS classes. The two paragraphs are set to a specific styling class for italics. Unfortunately we didn't create any normal paragraphs to showcase the difference, but you can take my <em>good word</em> that this site uses style classes.

          <p>
            Another project to practice using style classes, except that this site actually showcases the results. The main class is <em>"flashy"</em>: which styles text into a red, cursive font. An individual line on the list of cupcakes is given a more specific class, retaining <em>"flashy"</em> but overriding the red to blue.

            The first project to practice using divs and floats. While divs are perfectly fine (and just one float can be perfectly fine as well), multiple floats can be difficult to implement without them interfering with each other's placement. It might seem wonky now, but I dare ya' to resize the browser window.

          <p>
            A collection of animal profiles for a purely fabricated animal shelter. This practice made use of divs and floats, but turned out <strong>much</strong> cleaner. All text is contained within divs and wraps around images floated to the left. It's not very ambitious but it looks decent and withstands window resizing.

            By far the best looking site of the week, all due to the use of Bootstrap classes. Bootstrap offers stylesheets and scripts to quickly create complex website elements. While they were used mostly to build the navigation bar and carousel, a lot of the other visual design decisions that make the site look so good were made by my partner.
