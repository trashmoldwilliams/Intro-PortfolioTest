        <h1 class="about-me">About Me<h1>
        <p>
          I'm into various forms of storytelling, mostly video games and animations. Just out of high school, my only coding experience is taking a C++ class in freshman year and an HTML/CSS class in junior. I've made very simplistic (and unstable) text games and RPGs, but would like to know much more; as well as learning how to code cleanly and efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though my hobbies seem more art oriented, I get immense enjoyment from building programs, and would like to pursue a career in the coding industry.

          <p>
            My main hobby is designing games, though the only ones I've had the ability to actually create don't exceed the standards of a simple text game. I enjoy game theory outside of just video games (board games, made up sports, etc) but interactive games is the one I have been in contact with more than any other type of media.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building a fictional world and fleshing out game mechanics is the most fun I have out of any of my hobbies, and out of anything would like to pursue those ideas.
          </p>

        <div class=col-sm-4>
          <h1 class="about-me">Graphic Design<h1>
          <p>
             In my childhood I only thought of drawing as a way to convey my game ideas, I was more interested in the game design than the visual design part of the package. This is mostly still true today, but there is still a ton of enjoyment in creating standalone pieces every once and awhile.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides video games my other main media exposure was cartoons, and today I still tend to have a very simplified art style. The main things in the field I enjoy are character and background design, color scheming, and 2D animation. I have recently been learning 3D character modeling, but only a grasp on the basics.
        </div>
        <div class=col-sm-4>
          <h1 class="about-me">Screenwriting<h1>
          <p>
            Most of my interests in some way stem from my enjoyment of storytelling; the ability to pull someone into a completely fictional world inhabited by made up people is terrific.
          </p>
          <p>
             I get a similar enjoyment from building up a world as I do from building a program. Even something as simple as a text game can spark the imagination, even more than a multi-million dollar project with high quality visuals.
          </p>

            A barely fleshed out site used to practice the very basics of CSS styling, as well as implementing images and links to subpages. The images on the four subpages seem to be missing, and the best bet here is that we never added those image files to the repository. Now they are lost for <strong>all time</strong>.

            Though visually uninteresting, this project was created to practice CSS classes. The two paragraphs are set to a specific styling class for italics. Unfortunately we didn't create any normal paragraphs to showcase the difference, but you can take my <em>good word</em> that this site uses style classes.

            Another project to practice using style classes, except that this site actually showcases the results. The main class is <em>"flashy"</em>: which styles text into a red, cursive font. An individual line on the list of cupcakes is given a more specific class, retaining <em>"flashy"</em> but overriding the red to blue.

            The first project to practice using divs and floats. While divs are perfectly fine (and just one float can be perfectly fine as well), multiple floats can be difficult to implement without them interfering with each other's placement. It might seem wonky now, but I dare ya' to resize the browser window.

            A collection of animal profiles for a purely fabricated animal shelter. This practice made use of divs and floats, but turned out <strong>much</strong> cleaner. All text is contained within divs and wraps around images floated to the left. It's not very ambitious but it looks decent and withstands window resizing.

            By far the best looking site of the week, all due to the use of Bootstrap classes. Bootstrap offers stylesheets and scripts to quickly create complex website elements. While they were used mostly to build the navigation bar and carousel, a lot of the other visual design decisions that make the site look so good were made by my partner.
